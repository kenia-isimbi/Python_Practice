From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
... (omitting the rest for brevity) ... 
... much scholarly inquiry.
The Declaration justified the independence of the United States by listing colonial grievances against
King George III, and by asserting certain natural and legal rights, including a right of revolution.
Having served its original purpose in announcing independence, references to the text of the
Declaration were few in the following years. Abraham Lincoln made it the centerpiece of his rhetoric
(as in the Gettysburg Address of 1863) and his policies. Since then, it has become a well-known statement
on human rights, particularly its second sentence:

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their
Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.

This has been called "one of the best-known sentences in the English language", containing "the most potent
and consequential words in American history". The passage came to represent a moral standard to which
the United States should strive. This view was notably promoted by Abraham Lincoln, who considered the
Declaration to be the foundation of his political philosophy and argued that it is a statement of principles
through which the United States Constitution should be interpreted.

The U.S. Declaration of Independence inspired many other similar documents in other countries, the first
being the 1789 Declaration of Flanders issued during the Brabant Revolution in the Austrian Netherlands
(modern-day Belgium). It also served as the primary model for numerous declarations of independence across
Europe and Latin America, as well as Africa (Liberia) and Oceania (New Zealand) during the first half of the
19th century.'''
